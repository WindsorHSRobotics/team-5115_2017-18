## Message from the repository creator, the Great, Anthony Romero: "this is the team 5115 2017 repository. don't break it"

This repository is the result of the hard work of one of the greatest WHS robotics teams.  The members of this team were Anthony Romero, Dominic Scolari, Gavin Parrot and Liam McFadden.  Were it not for the failure to test the "claw systen" more thoroughly towards the end, they could have gone all the way (Let that be a lesson to all - fail to test at your own peril!).  Their repository includes an innovative omni wheel drive system using trigonometry which has resulted in a smoother, more responsive drive control all around.  Their innovative part designs should serve as an inspiration to all who view them.  Great work gentlemen, you will be immortalized here on GitHub.
